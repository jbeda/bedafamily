I'm a professional Software Engineer with experience with Microsoft and
Google, living and working in the Seattle area.

Most recently, I've been working on a hush hush project. Before that, I worked
on the Google Ad system to build tools to help advertisers pick the right
keywords and bids, connect Google services to the public telephone network
(PSTN) and defining and launching Google Talk.

My experience at Microsoft includes playing a key role in designing the next
generation graphics system for Windows (graphics and media APIs for WPF).
Prior to that I worked on MSHTML/Trident, the rendering engine for Internet
Explorer for IE 4, IE 5, IE 5.5 and IE 6. I worked with the core data
structures, parsing and drove performance across the product.

My education includes a BS in CS with High Distinction and Departmental Honors
from Harvey Mudd College in Claremont, California. During college I worked
with a local start up and did internships at Fermilab National Accelerator
Laboratory in Batavia, Illinois and at Microsoft in Redmond. The Microsoft
internships included working with the Project team and the Windows NT OpenGL
team.

I live in Seattle with my wife, a physician, and my son and daughter. I love
photography and this side is being developed to showcase some of the landscape
panoramics I've created.
