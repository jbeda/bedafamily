title: Many Glacier Sunrise
photodescription: &desc |
    This is the iconic view of [Many
    Glacier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many_Glacier). You can see the
    historic hotel off to the left. It really was that color.
    
    This photo is 10 images (2x5) sitched with Autopano Pro. I cropped it down a
    little to 96 megapixels.
