title: Second Beach Stump
photodescription: &desc |
    A driftwood stump on Second Beach on the Olympic Peninsula. This is a part
    of Olympic National Park that runs along the coast near Forks.
    
    This is an HDR pano totalling 372 megapixels made from 96 exposures
    (4x8x3). It took a little bit of playing to find a workflow that would
    work. Once file sizes get above 2GB a lot of tools stop working. I created
    individual HDR files for each camera position in photomatix and then
    merged those in Autopano Pro. The big stretches of featureless blue sky
    were tricky. I then stitched the photo and tonemapped in photomatix. I
    finally did a little bit of touching up and sharpening in Photoshop.
