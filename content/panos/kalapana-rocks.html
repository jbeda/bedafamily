title: Kalapana Rocks
photodescription: &desc |
    "Fresh" lava rock in Kalapana, HI on the Big Island. We drove down here
    hoping to find Lava but instead got to walk around on a rock that is only
    a few years old. Most of what you see here is actually less than 1 year
    old.
    
    This area actually used to be a subdivision that was [completely covered
    and destroyed](http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/kilauea/history/1990Kalapana/) in
    1990
    
    This is a 90 image HDR panorama (3x10x3). Merging to HDR was done with Photomatix
    Pro, stitching was done with Autopano Pro. The file was tonemapped with
    Photomatix Pro and then adjusted in Photoshop. The final image weighs in
    at 425 megapixels.
