title: Many Glacier Bridge
photodescription: &desc |
    This is from a photography trip to Glacier National Park in 2006. This is
    a bridge near the Many Glacier Hotel. There were great views both looking
    into the sunrise and the glow of the iconic peak on other side.
    
    This is an HDR merged image totaling ~83 megapixels. The individual
    exposures were stitched with Hugin and then the exposures were merged with
    Photoshop.
