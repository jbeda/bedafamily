title: Dungeness Log

    A driftwood along the Dungeness Spit. This is the first HDR pano that I've
    been able to do anything real with. There are some stitching artifacts and
    the focus shift isn't as smooth as could be.
    
    All images were imported and aligned in Hugin. A panorama was then
    stitched for each exposure level and photoshop was used for the HDR merge.
