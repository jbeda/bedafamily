title: Glacier Point
photodescription: &desc |
    Glacier Point in Yosemite can be accessed two ways. The first is a brutal
    hike up over 4 miles. The second is a road open in the summer. With the
    kids along we took the road up to the busy touristy visitor center
    complete with gift shop. It was worth the drive but I would have been
    dissapointed to have hiked up considering here was no solitude available.
    
    This is an enormous 903 megapixel HDR pano. It was made up of 225 images
    (5*15*3) and was created by first merging to 32bpp HDR images using
    Photomatix Pro, stitching with Autopano Pro and finally tone mapping and
    adjusting with Photoshop.
