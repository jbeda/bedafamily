title: Hoh Rainforest Tree
photodescription: &desc |
    A little while ago I went on a weekend trip with some friends to the
    peninsula. This tree was captured in the Hoh Rainforest. This is a
    particularly large pano at 858 megapixels. This is the middle exposure of
    three. I'd like to try and do an HDR version but I'm still exploring the
    tools available.
