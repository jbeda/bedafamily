title: Idaho Mission
photodescription: &desc |
    This is the beautiful [Cataldo
    Mission](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Mission_State_Park) in northern
    Idaho. We passed through this area on our way to Yellowstone in 2009. I
    loved the texture and color on the ceiling and the floor
    
    This HDR processed image is slightly cropped down from the original to 565
    megapixels (4x~11x3). I processed bracketed sets into HDR files with
    Photomatix, stitched with Autopano Pro and then tone mapped with
    Photoshop. I couldn't get Photomatix to tone map an image this large.
